##The Project for Phase2 by Ibrahim Alkhowaiter (MERN and DPM)

The project is missing "node_modules" folder, I coudn't upload it because the folder's size, I'll uplode a .zip file with the submission that contains all the file needed to run the app, but if you will downlaod the app from here, you should first run this lines of code in the terminal so the app will run appropriately:
```
    npm i --save
    npm i react-redux
    npm i redux
    npm i --save redux-thunk
```
and lastly to start the app
```
    npm start
```
