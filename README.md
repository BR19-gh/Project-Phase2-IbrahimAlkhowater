## The Project for Phase2 (Creating a Front-End Application Using React, Redux, and NodeJS) by Ibrahim Alkhowaiter (MERN and DPM)

The project is missing **node_modules** folder, I coudn't upload it because the folder's size, I'll provide a .zip file link via OneDrive with the submission that contains all the file needed to run the app, but if you will downlaod the app from here instead, you should first run this lines of code in the terminal to download **node_modules** so the app will run appropriately:
```
    npm i --save
    npm i react-redux
    npm i redux
    npm i --save redux-thunk
```
and lastly to start the app
```
    npm start
```
